(1)
WAP to find display the even numbers between 10 and 20. The display should include 10 and 20.

The program even.c is provided in the repository for your reference. Implement a similar program in MIPS using the file named even.asm.

There is no need to use mod function. Simply setting up a loop with add instruction should be sufficient to implement this program in MIPS.

The expected output is:
10
12
14
16
18
20

WAP to find display the odd numbers between 11 and 21. The display should include 11 and 21.

The program odd.c is provided in the repository for your reference. Implement a similar program in MIPS using the file named odd.asm.

The expected output is:
11
13
15
17
19
21
