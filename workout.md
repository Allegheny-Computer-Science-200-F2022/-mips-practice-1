Rainfall-1 circuit is an implementation of gates.c program at the hardware level. One of the limitation with this circuit is that if we turn on all the three inputs [first, second, and third] then both "get ready to leave" and "avoid getting wet" is turned on as output! However, if you try running the gates.c program "only get ready to leave" is displayed as the output for all the three inputs turned on. 

Now your task is first to "re-create" the rainfall-1 circuit using logisim. The command to be run to open logism is provided in the commands file provided in the repository. After opening logisim, design the circuit by following step by step the design provided in the image file named rainfall-1. 

After completing the design, click File->saveas to save the file using your name such as rainfall-amohan-1 on your laptop. Here amohan should be replaced with your name. 

Next, create a new circuit using your name such as  rainfall-amohan-2 on your laptop. Again amohan should be replaced with your name. The new circuit may just be a copy of rainfall-amohan-1 circuit. Think about how to address this limitation and redesign the circuit accordingly to resolve this issue. 

The solution is provided in the file "rainfall-2" circuit in the repository. Take a look at the solution only after you had tried to design the circuit by yourself!

Upload both versions of rainfall-amohan-1 and rainfall-amohan-2 circuit. Again amohan should be replaced with your name.
